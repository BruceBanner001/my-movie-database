            "value": "Despite being a bit of a prickly pear, Jang Jae Yeol has become famous for authoring mystery novels and for hosting a popular radio show. While sitting on a talk show panel with psychiatrist Ji Hae Soo, it became clear to all that the two just rubbed each other the wrong way. \n\nThe unthinkable happens when Jae Yeol’s girlfriend plagiarizes his work, forcing him to lie low until the media storm blows\n\nover. Only then he can prove his innocence. Jae Yeol moves into a house he owns but rents out. One of the current tenants, is none other than Hae Soo, unwittingly making them housemates.\n\nAdd to the mix Jo Dong Min, Hae Soo’s senior colleague and fellow psychiatrist, and Park Soo Kwang, a young man with Tourette’s Syndrome. As personalities clash, Jae Yeol and Hae Soo help the other heal from their deeply-rooted emotional scars.",
