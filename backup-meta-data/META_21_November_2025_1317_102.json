            "value": "The story centers on two individuals with contrasting memory conditions. Jeong Hoon, a charismatic news anchor, possesses hyperthymesia, enabling him to recall life's minutiae in exquisite detail. Haunted by the memory of Seo Yeon, the woman he loved but who vanished eight years ago, Jeong Hoon exudes both charm and aggression. Meanwhile, Ha Jin, a rising star in the spotlight, has a fading memory. Despite her condition, she remains confident. These two\n\ncharacters, each with their unique memory challenges, cross paths and face the test of understanding, acceptance, and perhaps even love.",
