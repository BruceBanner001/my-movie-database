            "value": "People change, but can the heart adapt? Sin Jun Yeong and No Eul were in love in their younger days. But uncontrollable circumstances separated them, and they went their separate ways. Jun Yeong is now a superstar actor and singer, while No Eul has become a producer-director of documentaries. \n\nWhen their paths cross again years later, Jun Yeong discovers that No Eul is now a very different person than he remembered —\n\nmaterialistic and willing to do anything to get ahead. Is there any hope for Jun Yeong and No Eul to rekindle their past relationship?\n\n(Source: Viki)",
