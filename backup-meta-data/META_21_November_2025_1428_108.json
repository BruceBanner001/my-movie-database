There, Young witnesses Joon's violent behavior and accidentally vomits on him. Young loses her job and is convinced that Joon has to be behind her firing. She retaliates by demonstrating in front of Joon’s management office, where her picketing eventually garners some media attention and the anti-fan label. \n\nA producer approaches her\n\nabout participating in a reality TV show whose premise is that of a celebrity living with their anti-fan. Unemployed, she jumps at the opportunity.  Meanwhile, Joon is offered the same show and accepts, thinking that it could only improve his image. When filming begins, Joon and Young try to give each other a hard time on set, only to fall head over heels for one another.\n\n(Source: MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel \"So I Married an Anti-fan\" (그래서 나는 안티팬과 결혼했다) by Kim Eun Jung (김은정).",
