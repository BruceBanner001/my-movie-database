# Project requirements

The project uses these Python packages (managed via `requirements.txt`):

- pandas
- openpyxl
- requests
- Pillow (PIL)
- beautifulsoup4
- lxml
- ddgs (optional)
- google-api-python-client
- google-auth
- google-auth-httplib2
- google-auth-oauthlib
- gdown

The GitHub Actions workflow installs `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the script.
