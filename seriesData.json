I usually get bored by a drama that\u2019s too sad so I like how they insert comedic scenes in between.

His crying scenes have different emotions and meanings especially his breakdown scene on episode 9. It felt like he poured his heart and soul on that scene and the audience felt it. The fact that KSH was able to get rave reviews for his performance both internationally and locally",

            "soundtrack",
            "that KSH was able to showcase such amazing and brilliant acting range for a role that's quite a challenge... that's really IMPRESSIVE and not all actors would be able to accomplish that.. I'm just happy that KSH is a risk taker and took this risk and not doing the usual OPPA dramas. CINEMATOGRAPHY/MUSICAL SCORING/EDITING - We have to commend the cinematographer of this show. WOW. just WOW! the camera shots are so perfect. i love how the cinematographer used different techniques. It was so effective. Same as the editing. I love the transitions from one scene to another. Not just the cool transitions but just the regular transitions where musical scoring is used to properly connect one scene from another. OVERALL - this show will be one of my all time favorites. I have to admit that i expected more from the mother's plot. maybe because i watch too many crime dramas and i wanted more explanation how the mother survived or what really happened. I guess i overthought and had watched too many theory videos that i forgot what the show was all about. Thank you to the Finale episode\"FINDING THE REAL FACE\". My take on the mother's plot is very simple. The mother survived and whatever stories we saw from the father's POV and MY's are not really accurate since  the father had brain injury and even had major surgery for that",

I'm happy to be one of the active posters in IOTNBO page and one of the users who broke records of having 16k+++ comments on the 16th episode. Most of all",

            "there will surely come a day when you\u2019ll be able to run again.\u201d Another thing I really loved about this drama is how it was able to incorporate fairytales and stories in every episode. Ko Moon Young\u2019s stories in particular were all really good",

            "this show is a character driven kind of drama. You have to immerse yourself in the drama to fully understand and go through the process of healing while watching the show. STORY - I really love the story. It's unique and refreshing how the writer used many fairy tale and folk tales references and combined all those stories into one. It's so brilliant. ACTING - Now let's talk about the performances for the Actors. Immediately after watching episode 1",
            "who I felt closer to than any character I\u2019ve seen before. Honestly",
            "you will be amazed already of Oh Jung Seng's performance. It really is a role of a lifetime. He is so effective as Moon Sang Tae. I cry on most of his scenes with Gang Tae. He exceeded everyone's expectations and he will definitely get many awards from this show. Seo Ye Ji's role is also very challenging. She is phenomenal as Moon Young.
