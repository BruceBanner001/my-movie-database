The casting choice was good. The acting was strong and kept me engaged and the plot setup was interesting but I found trouble connecting with the story. I felt as if the details of this story was missing. There were a lot of time jumps",

            "it is more about just showing you what it can do. And that's how you know that the actors did a great job of conveying the thoughts and emotions of the characters through their acting. I was so engrossed by the character writing that my attention is sucked in and the main couple are Writer and Artist",
            "like this and that\" just from how they are speed running the build-up on how they become a couple in the beginning. And I didn't mind that just because I've seen it being similarly done before a thousand times doesn't mean I'm not going to enjoy it. I still kept watching because I was curious how they gonna do it.
