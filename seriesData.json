        "synopsis": "Zhao Jiang Yue is the somewhat tyrannical head of a tech firm. She is known for her no-nonsense approach to business - and her employees. The firm releases a dating app that promises to match users with a partner in the space of just three months. She is also somewhat clueless in affairs of the heart herself. But things start to get uncomfortable at work when the family who own the companymake arrangements for Gu Jia Xin, the heir to the business group that owns the company, to join as Zhao Jiang Yue's temporary assistant.\n\nGu Jia Xin's mother wants him to take charge of the business, but he has other ideas. He is a successful pro racing driver and is wildly popular with his female fans, and would rather compete on the motorcycle track than spend time in the boardroom. At first, the duo gets off on the wrong foot: Zhao Jiang Yue tries to intimidate him, and Gu Jia Xin's bumbling causes problems. But when she enlists Gu Jia Xin's help to try to capture Xu Ning Yuan's heart, he suddenly starts to realize that he is developing feelings for her, and that the feeling just might be mutual...\n\n(",
