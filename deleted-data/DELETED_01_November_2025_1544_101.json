        "but I wish people would watch it",
        "but Kai is wonderfully and deliciously beautiful. - The drama focused on human behavior. And the mesaage it send is a good one. The things that I wasn't sure about: - This was more of a slow paced drama. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But around the middle part",
        "complicated. I",
        "especially Kim Myung Min (he will for me be one of the best male performance in drama this year with Lee Sun Kyun and Ji Jin Hee). Not to forget the OST  that mixed really well with all the scenes! I don't give it a 10 because this drama had a little problem",

        "he was quite important in the beginning because we saw him quite often but after we didn't saw him at all",
        "it did seem a bit draggy. - A lot of moral dilemmas involved in the drama which I wasn't sure how to feel about. While the drama wasn't solely focused on romantic relationships",
        "it's a drama that deserves a chance. And it's quite enjoyable. So",
        "like some people said in the comments",
        "not many did thought it was really really good! If you like family",
        "not one of my ultimate favorite but still it was really well done. From the not predictable story which is really rare to do with k-dramas because you generally always know how it's going to end; to the superb acting done by everyone",
        "romance",
        "so I was like why did they introduce this guy to us if at the end they don't even matter?? (people who watched it will know about who I'm talking). I don't think everyone can like that kind of drama because a lot of people prefer to watch basic rom-com with young actors most of the time (and ofc I like it too)",
        "that they never expected is portrayed wonderfully. - The music is good. Specially the song 'Monochrome'. It fit the settings perfectly. - The kid actors did a good job too. - Not to sound like a fangirl or anything",
        "there could be a right and wrong in such exaggerated fantasical situation. Overall",
        "there was a little disappointment with one of the character story turn",
        "they were quite...well",
        "to an extent anyway. The things that I liked about the drama: -The storyline is unique. Not the one-person's-soul-entering-another-body thing. But the part that came after that. - The acting is top notch. You can feel every emotion of Song Huun Chul",
        "to the extent that they were present",
        "wasn't sure if what the male lead was doing could be considered \"right\". If"
