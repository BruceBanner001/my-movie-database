        "and Oh Jung Se anymore. It is Moon Kang Tae",
        "and Oh Jung Se showed us stellar acting performances and broke my heart so many times. Even the supporting characters were really good at their roles. The OST was something that kept me going while waiting each week and I really appreciate how they had English songs. I also loved how the story had a balance between sad and happy moments. I usually get bored by a drama that\u2019s too sad so I like how they insert comedic scenes in between. There are also so many relatable quotes and one of my favorites is a piece of advice from Doctor Oh. \u201cWhen you\u2019re tired",
        "and creative transitions. Kim Soo Hyun",

        "as a fan of KSH",
        "awesome animation",
        "being such amazing actors themselves could have easily stole the limelight from KSH. Moon Gang Tae's character was less explosive and more contemplative. His role is very deep and requires consistency. Many of his emotions must be conveyed using his eyes alone. and he did it perfectly. His crying scenes have different emotions and meanings especially his breakdown scene on episode 9. It felt like he poured his heart and soul on that scene and the audience felt it. The fact that KSH was able to get rave reviews for his performance both internationally and locally",
        "but like in any fairy tale",
        "especially the one in the ending. I admire the writer for writing these fairytales on top of writing a drama. I know this drama is by no means perfect. It still left me with a few questions about Moon Young\u2019s mom. But truth be told",
        "everything made sense to me that this drama is not about MY's mother. It's about the journey of Moon Young",

        "he chose It's Okay to Not Be Okay. He really took time in reading  many scripts and he really wants to challenge himself. His role is not as flashy or flamboyant as Moon Young and Sang Tae.... What makes his performance a stand out was the fact that his character wasn't a stand out. SYJ and OJS",
        "i just like to say that this Series is not for everyone. I know everyone has different tastes especially in dramas. Aside from being a HUMAN HEALING DRAMA",
        "i learned so much from this drama. I immersed myself in the show and this show really healed me to overcome some of the trauma and regrets i have in my life. The title itself is such a meaningful and powerful  phrase that \"It's Okay to Not Be Okay\".  Here are some of the lessons i learned from this drama. - Family is Beyond Blood Relations - Fight for your Happiness - Don't Make Rash Decisions - Don't Judge a book by its cover - Confront your Trauma - Remember Good Memories - Speak Up for Yourself - Reach Out for Help - It's Better to Kiss than Fight \"When you're tired get some rest.

        "i was really waiting for his comeback and has high expectations on the first project he'll work on. THANK GOD",

        "in the end",
        "it wasn\u2019t all the sad moments. The characters in this drama felt so real that I even cried out of happiness for them. Every time I watch this",
        "soundtrack",
        "that KSH was able to showcase such amazing and brilliant acting range for a role that's quite a challenge... that's really IMPRESSIVE and not all actors would be able to accomplish that.. I'm just happy that KSH is a risk taker and took this risk and not doing the usual OPPA dramas. CINEMATOGRAPHY/MUSICAL SCORING/EDITING - We have to commend the cinematographer of this show. WOW. just WOW! the camera shots are so perfect. i love how the cinematographer used different techniques. It was so effective. Same as the editing. I love the transitions from one scene to another. Not just the cool transitions but just the regular transitions where musical scoring is used to properly connect one scene from another. OVERALL - this show will be one of my all time favorites. I have to admit that i expected more from the mother's plot. maybe because i watch too many crime dramas and i wanted more explanation how the mother survived or what really happened. I guess i overthought and had watched too many theory videos that i forgot what the show was all about. Thank you to the Finale episode\"FINDING THE REAL FACE\". My take on the mother's plot is very simple. The mother survived and whatever stories we saw from the father's POV and MY's are not really accurate since  the father had brain injury and even had major surgery for that",
        "the OK staff and patients. Everyone had amazing perfomances. Now for my bias",
        "there so many life learning quotes in this show. Watching this while on air is the best decision i made this year. Usually i will wait for a show to be completed before i binge watch but i made an exception for IOTNBO. I really invested too much in this drama. I'm happy to be one of the active posters in IOTNBO page and one of the users who broke records of having 16k+++ comments on the 16th episode. Most of all",
        "there will always be a happy ending. Reading this definitely gave me some closure on the mother mystery : https://chasehermes.tumblr.com/post/625989613310394368/i-was-thinking-about-why-the-show-did-not-discuss I have to say that this drama has one of the best finales and most satisfying endings I've ever watched. I don't know how many times i cried watching all episodes but one thing is for sure",
        "there will surely come a day when you\u2019ll be able to run again.\u201d Another thing I really loved about this drama is how it was able to incorporate fairytales and stories in every episode. Ko Moon Young\u2019s stories in particular were all really good",
        "this is the first time I ever felt this way about a drama. I\u2019ve watched ongoing dramas but I have never been this excited for every episode. My Saturdays and Sundays were never the same and without meaning to",
        "this show is a character driven kind of drama. You have to immerse yourself in the drama to fully understand and go through the process of healing while watching the show. STORY - I really love the story. It's unique and refreshing how the writer used many fairy tale and folk tales references and combined all those stories into one. It's so brilliant. ACTING - Now let's talk about the performances for the Actors. Immediately after watching episode 1",
        "who I felt closer to than any character I\u2019ve seen before. Honestly",
        "you will be amazed already of Oh Jung Seng's performance. It really is a role of a lifetime. He is so effective as Moon Sang Tae. I cry on most of his scenes with Gang Tae. He exceeded everyone's expectations and he will definitely get many awards from this show. Seo Ye Ji's role is also very challenging. She is phenomenal as Moon Young. I cannot think of anyone who can do this role as perfect as her. Supporting Roles from the younger casts",
