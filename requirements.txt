# 'create_update_backup_delete.py' script. The GitHub Actions
# workflow uses this file to install the correct dependencies.
# ==========================================

# === Core Data Handling ===
pandas>=2.0.0            # Essential for reading and processing data from Excel files (.xlsx).
openpyxl>=3.1.0          # The engine that pandas uses under the hood to read/write modern Excel files.

# === Web Scraping & Networking ===
requests>=2.31.0         # The workhorse for making all HTTP requests to download web pages and images.
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0   # The primary library for parsing and navigating the HTML content of fetched web pages.

Pillow>=10.0.0           # Crucial for processing downloaded images: resizing, converting to RGB, and saving as optimized JPEGs.

# === Google Drive API Integration ===
# These two packages are the only ones you need to specify directly. They handle the
# entire process of authenticating with Google and interacting with the Drive API.
# They will automatically install other required helper libraries (like google-auth-httplib2).
