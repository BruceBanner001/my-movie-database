Patch A applied:
- Robust deletion handling with deleted-data files and 'deleted_not_found' notes in reports.
- Improved synopsis fetcher: respects site order, cleans CJK parenthetical text, appends source.
- showName lowercased and whitespace-normalized.
- Reports saved as TXT only. Secret-exposure check and success/failure emails in workflow.
